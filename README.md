## About go-autumn-logging-zerolog

Implementation that pulls in logging using [zerolog](https://github.com/rs/zerolog).

### Features

* context aware
* provides context injection middleware for standard golang http server
* fairly good performance
* support for JSON and plaintext logging

## Usage

### Library Authors

Do NOT import this. You are doing it WRONG. You'll take away the application author's choice of 
logging libraries, which is the whole point of using go-autumn-logging in the first place.

Use [go-autumn-logging](https://github.com/StephanHCB/go-autumn-logging) (the api module) only!

### Application Authors

You're all set with this dependency, just make sure you call one of the provided `Setup` functions
to set up either JSON or plaintext logging. The simplest example for JSON logging

```
auzerolog.SetupJsonLogging("application-name")
```

and for plaintext logging:

```
auzerolog.SetupPlaintextLogging()
```

If you don't like our choice of fields or styling, you can easily customize everything by providing your own 
Setup-style function to call instead.

### How To Use

Use call chaining style:

```
import "github.com/StephanHCB/go-autumn-logging"

func someFunction(ctx context.Context) {
    aulogging.Logger.Ctx(ctx).Warn("something bad has happened")
}
```

or if you prefer:

```
import "github.com/StephanHCB/go-autumn-logging"

func someFunction(ctx context.Context) {
    aulogging.Warn(ctx, "something bad has happened")
}
```
